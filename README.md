Art Strike is a free to play, open source 2D fighting game made by collaborating artists. Each
artist contributes their original character or original artwork to create a game where art styles
clash with their fists. Inspired by fighting games like street fighter and super smash bros each
character will have unique abilities, strength and weakness pitched by participating artists. Art
Strike will include breath-taking stages and collectible lore and artwork.
